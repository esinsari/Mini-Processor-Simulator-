# Mini-Processor-Simulator-

The core part of a mini processor simulator called MySPIM using C language on a Unix platform. 
MySPIM will demonstrate some functions of MIPS processor as well as the principle of the datapath and the control signals of MIPS processor.
The MySPIM simulator should read in a file containing MIPS machine code and simulate what the MIPS does cycle-by-cycle.
Required to implement the MySPIM with a single-cycle datapath.
